# [2.0.0](https://github.com/Lange/node-elgato-stream-deck/compare/v1.2.0...v2.0.0) (2017-11-28)

### Features

* add `fillPanel` method
* add `clearAllKeys` method
* return the `StreamDeck` constructor instead of automatically instantiating it
* allow providing a `devicePath` to the constructor
  * if no device path is provided, will attempt to use the first found Stream Deck. Errors if no Stream Decks are connected.
* update `this.keyState` *before* emitting `down` and `up` events
  * this is technically a *breaking change*, but is very unlikely to affect any production code

### Bug Fixes

* fix center-cropping in `fillImageFromFile`
* fix `sharp` only being a `devDependency`, and not a production `dependency`

### Code Refactoring
* refactor `StreamDeck` class to move as much as possible to static methods and static getters
* refactor code to use `async`/`await`
  * this is a *breaking change*, because we now only support Node.js v7.6 or newer

### Documentation

* update all examples
* add `fillPanel` example

### BREAKING CHANGES

* `this.keyState` is now updated **before** `down` and `up` events are emitted.
* Support for versions of Node.js earlier than 7.6 has been dropped.
* The `StreamDeck` constructor is now required when `require`ing this library, instead of an instance of the class.
	* See the docs for updated examples.
